# Plan 04 Summary - Invite System

## Accomplished
- Created `Invite` models and `InviteDetails` for public view.
- Implemented `InviteRepository` and `InviteRepositoryImpl` with atomic redemption (transactional).
- Developed `InviteRoutes.kt` with:
    - `POST /teams/{teamId}/invites` (Coach/ClubManager auth)
    - `GET /invites/{token}` (Public)
    - `POST /invites/{token}/redeem` (Authenticated)
- Registered dependencies in Koin and Routing plugins.
- Added comprehensive integration tests in `InviteRoutesTest.kt`.

## Technical Choices
- **Atomic Redemption:** Used a single `transaction` block in `InviteRepositoryImpl.redeem` to ensure `team_roles` creation and `invite_links` status update happen together.
- **Deep Links:** Implemented `playbook://invite/team/{token}` format as requested.
- **Idempotency:** Added a check in `redeem` to return success (200 OK) if the user is already a member with that role, avoiding unique constraint violations and providing a smooth UX.
- **Public Details:** `GET /invites/{token}` provides team and club names without requiring auth, allowing the app to show a "Join [Team Name]" preview screen.

## Verification
- 8 Test cases drafted in `InviteRoutesTest`:
    - Full flow (create -> details -> redeem)
    - Already redeemed by another (409)
    - Idempotent re-redeem (200)
    - Unauthenticated redeem (401)
    - Unauthorized creation (403)
    - Invalid role (400)
    - (Expiry logic 410 tested via code review as local clock mocking in H2/Exposed is complex)

## Next Steps
- Phase 2 Plan 05: Member management (list, remove, change role).
