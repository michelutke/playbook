# Summary - Plan 05 (Team Management UI)

## Accomplishments
- **Domain Models**: Added `Club`, `Team`, `TeamMember`, and `InviteDetails` to shared module.
- **Client Repositories**: Implemented `ClubRepository`, `TeamRepository`, and `InviteRepository` with Ktor HTTP calls.
- **Club Setup**: Created `ClubSetupScreen` and `ClubSetupViewModel` for creating clubs and uploading logos.
- **Team Roster**: Created `TeamRosterScreen` and `TeamRosterViewModel` with member listing, removal (with confirmation), and invite generation.
- **Invite Flow**: Created `InviteScreen` and `InviteViewModel` to handle deep links (`playbook://invite/team/{token}`), showing invite details and allowing users to join or redirect to registration.
- **Navigation**:
    - Updated `Screen.kt` with new routes.
    - Updated `AppNavigation.kt` to wire up the new screens.
    - Updated `EmptyStateScreen` to navigate to Club Setup and handle invite link pasting.
    - Updated `PlaybookApp.kt` to support back navigation and provide login state to the navigation graph.
- **DI**: Updated Koin modules in both shared and composeApp (Android & iOS) to include new repositories and viewmodels.
- **Deep Linking**: Verified `AndroidManifest.xml` contains the necessary intent filter for `playbook://`.

## Technical Notes
- Used `NavBackStackEntry` for navigation as per existing pattern.
- Implemented state-driven UI with `MutableStateFlow` in ViewModels.
- Repositories handle error states and return `Result` types.
- Navigation transitions are handled via `LaunchedEffect` listening to ViewModel events/state changes.
- UI components use `PlaybookTheme` design tokens.

## Next Steps
- Implement actual image picker integration for logo upload.
- Implement platform-specific share sheet for invite links.
- Test deep link integration on physical devices/emulators.
- Proceed to Plan 06 (Tests).
