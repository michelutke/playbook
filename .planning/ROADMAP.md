## Phase 4 — Attendance Tracking
**Goal:** Core attendance loop works end-to-end including offline, Abwesenheit, and coach overrides.

**Requirements:** AT-01–16

**Plans:** 7/7 plans complete

Plans:
- [ ] 04-01-PLAN.md — Backend data foundation (V8 migration, Exposed tables, server repositories)
- [ ] 04-02-PLAN.md — Server API routes (attendance, abwesenheit, check-in) + background jobs
- [ ] 04-03-PLAN.md — Shared KMP contracts (domain models, repository interfaces, SQLDelight offline schema)
- [ ] 04-04-PLAN.md — Shared KMP repository impls + offline mutation queue + stats calculator
- [ ] 04-05-PLAN.md — Event list + detail attendance UI (RSVP buttons, member list, Begrundung sheet)
- [ ] 04-06-PLAN.md — Coach override sheet + absence management UI (AddAbsenceSheet, profile integration)
- [ ] 04-07-PLAN.md — End-to-end wiring + automated tests (server integration + stats unit tests)

**Deliverables:**
- Per-event response UI (confirm / decline / unsure + Begründung)
- Response deadline enforcement (client UX + server 409)
- Abwesenheit: recurring weekly + period absence, auto-decline
- Manual coach override (present/absent/excused + note)
- Attendance list per event (all members + statuses)
- Attendance statistics (% presence, filters) — including player profile stats section (TM-17 deferred from Phase 2)
- Offline mutation queue + sync
- Audit log for coach overrides
- Automated tests: response flows, deadline enforcement, offline sync, Abwesenheit

**Deferred from Phase 2:**
- TM-17: Attendance stats section in PlayerProfileScreen (requires attendance table)
- TM-19: When adding attendance table, ensure `team_roles` FK uses `SET NULL` on member removal (not CASCADE) — `TeamRepositoryImpl.removeMember()` currently hard-deletes

**Success criteria:**
1. Player can confirm/decline/unsure; coach sees response immediately
2. Abwesenheit auto-declines events; manual override takes precedence
3. Late sync rejected with 409 (server authoritative)
4. Offline responses sync correctly when back online
5. Statistics correct for a player with mixed attendance history

- TeamRolesTable Exposed object updated to nullable user_id + SET NULL (PARTIAL-01)

## Phase Order Rationale

Auth -> Teams -> Events -> Attendance -> Notifications -> Admin

Each phase depends on the previous. At the end of each phase, the product is working and testable for everything shipped so far.
